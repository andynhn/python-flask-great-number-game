# python-flask-great-number-game
Site that creates a random number between 1-100 and stores the number in session. The site allows the user to guess at the number and tells them when they are too high or too low. If they guess the correct number, they can start a new game. Objective is to (1) practice using session to store data about a client's history with a web app; (2) practice clearing session; and (3) practice having the server use data submitted by a client with a form.
